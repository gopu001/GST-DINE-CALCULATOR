# GST-DINE-CALCULATOR
This project is a GST (Goods and Services Tax) calculator specifically designed for restaurants. The website opens with a user-friendly interface prompting users to enter their personal details, such as name and contact information. Once registered, users can input the amounts for soups, starters, main courses, and desserts they have ordered. The GST calculator then processes this information to provide a detailed bill inclusive of applicable taxes.
